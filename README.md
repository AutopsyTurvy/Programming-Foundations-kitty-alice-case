Hello Noroff Teachers!



This object has the following properties:
- manufacturer (String): The manufacturer of the brand of sewing machine- could also have been an array with other brands (take note for future)
- Stitches Per Inch (Number), the usual/ default number of stitches in each inch of sewing.
-Thread Length, in meters (Number)
- Object of function/ Object of decoration- (Boolean values), to ascertain whether the object can be used or whether its sole purpose is decor.
- Necessary Accoutrements/ additional equpiment needed (Array)
- "Power on" (powerOn) is set to false which states the default power state of the sewing machine.

-The function here uses a mix of "if statements", "for loops" and a little bit of string concatenation- each time the machine is switched on it consumes ten meters of the 100 meter thread spool, then is switched off again.
With more experience I hope I might know how to calculate how many inches had been stitched based on how many seconds the machine was used for or how much speed the machine was using- soon!
